## Some tips for better handling of the project
### It is clearly understood that hardcoded values are not to be used in code. However, for the better ease of development these variables are hardcoded:
1. Port address (/index.js)
2. JWT token key (/controller/auth-controller.js, /middleware/verify/token) - "myKey"
3. Mongodb uri (/db/connect.js) - needs to be changed according to the local mongodb address

Tools needed to install:
1. NPM
2. Node
3. MongoDB
